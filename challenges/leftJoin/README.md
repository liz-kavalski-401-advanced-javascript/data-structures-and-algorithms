# Challenge Summary
Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps.

## Challenge Description
Write a function that take-in two hashmaps into a single data structure. The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.While the second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.Then combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic.
*  LEFT JOIN means all the values in the first hashmap are returned, and if values exist in the “right” hashmap, they are appended to the result row. If no values exist in the right hashmap, then some flavor of NULL should be appended to the result row.
