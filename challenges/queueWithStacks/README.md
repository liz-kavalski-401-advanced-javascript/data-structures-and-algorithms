# Challenge Summary
 Build a Queue with two stacks
## Challenge Description
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface: enqueue(value) and dequeue(), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. 

## Approach & Efficiency
So what I try it do is with the enqueue(value) it have it add the value at the begining of the Queue while with  dequeue() it will pop off at the end.
