# Challenge Summary
The challenge was to create a queue that had a  frist in and frist out concept. For example if I had a queue '1->2->3' the '1' would be the frist one out because it was the frist one in the queue.

## Challenge Description
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.

## Approach & Efficiency
I made them into arrays and used the arrary methods `shift` and `unshift` to add or remove the frist element of the array.
