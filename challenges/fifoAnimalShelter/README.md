# Challenge Summary
The challenge was to create a queue that had a  frist in and frist out concept. For example if I had a queue '1->2->3' the '1' would be the frist one out because it was the frist one in the queue.

## Challenge Description
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.

## Approach & Efficiency
I made class that used two queues, one for dogs and one for cats. The queues use arrays and the arrary methods. This allowed me to  that push the new animal to the corrsponding queue. If the animal a cat it got add to the cat queue, if the animal was a dog it was add to the dog queue. Then for dequeue the user put in an preference animal(cat/dog) and look at the corrensponding queue and `shift` the animal off the queue .
