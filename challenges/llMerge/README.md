# Challenge Summary
Create a Linked List method that merages two Linked List togther and return a new Linked List.

## Challenge Description
THe challenge was to create a method that merage two linked lists together like a zipper.

## Approach & Efficiency
We discuss what would be best to achive the goal along with makeing sure the code ran liner (O of 1), We started whiteboarding the soluation and if we got stuck discusssed ways to get un-stuck, if we were both stuck we resceach differnt solution, along with discussing them and testing them out on the console. We also went to make sure the method didn't sort the two Linked List based on value, because based on the examples given in Canvas of the outputs it sould not matter what the value are it should fellow the pattern of:(Linked List =LL) LL1 -> LL2-> LL1-> LL2 -> null.
