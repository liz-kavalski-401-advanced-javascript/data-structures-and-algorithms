# Hashtables
Hashtables are a tyoe of data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found

## Challenge
Create a class funtion with:
`add`: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
`get`: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
`contains`: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
`hash`: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
