 # Sorted Array
Reserch three given methods  to sort array and create a 'blog' post about the different sort method. This include how each of the different array sort and how each of them work.

## Challenge
  #### [Insertion Sort](https://github.com/liz-kavalski-401-advanced-javascript/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/sortarray/insertionSort/BLOG.md)
  Make a insertion sort methods based on the Insertion Sort Algorithms 
#### [Merge Sort](https://github.com/liz-kavalski-401-advanced-javascript/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/sortarray/mergeSort/BLOG.md)
  Make a merge sort methods based on the Merge Sort Algorithms 
#### [Quick Sort](https://github.com/liz-kavalski-401-advanced-javascript/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/sortarray/quickSort/BLOG.md)
  Make a quick sort methods based on the Quick Sort Algorithms 
## Approach & Efficiency
A lot of reserch on each of the different methods. Along with testing of each methods to see if it work.
