# Trees
A Data structure that makes it easier to look through data
## Challenge
Create a class for Binary Tree that has methods called preOrder, inOrder and postOrder that orgainze the data in a curtain order.

Along with creating a class for Binary Search Tree that has an add methods that add a value and a new node to the the tree. Then also a contains methods that return either ture or false if the value is in the tree
## Approach & Efficiency
The Binary Tree is what was done in class on Saturday. The Binary Search Tree for add I looked if it has a root, if not give it one. Then set the root as current. Then looked at the current value to determine if it gose left or right.

The contain part in the Binary Search tree class I check it their is a root or if the value is the same,which return either true, or faluse. Then it look through each of the branchs it see if their any matchs
